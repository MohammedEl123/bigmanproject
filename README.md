# bigmanproject:

this is a website to track progress and evaluate my progress when improving coding skills

as i learn more and get more experience in my coding and software engineer journey i will keep improving on the website as much as possible 

i am by no means proffesional but i am keen to learn what i have learned and what will learn 

the journey is long to become a good software engineer and i think i can learn alot from this community and as i already have 

soon enough i will be learning more and becoming better. i have learned HTML5 , CSS3 , JavaScript frameworks and some of thier respective libraries like bulma , react and bootstrap. its been a learning curve and its been tough to understand somethings but i will be honest thats this is singlehandedly the greatest community of web developers i have seen evrybody wants you to learn and to share their knowlege with you and other people ranging from questions to issues that other devs have with their code its truly wonderful and even more so to be a part of .

passion: 

 i have recently learned that i have a passion for coding from a young age i used to use "scratch" to do simple coding like a little movie . i always liked computers and i think always will  it evolved to HTML5 and started to make websites that looked like they were in the 1980's when it was 2013 
 the reason i am making this website is to mesure progress and success as i feel this is the only way to do it but also to make a change in the world and potentially make a store that would sell large clothing around the world especially where it is under-represented 
 
 hopefully soon ill be making more iderations of my code and it will change overtime to hopefully something spectacular that i can be proud of its not great now but soon  it will be . 
 
 hopefully ill see some of you soon
